# Implementation status

This is the operational handoff between Claude Code sessions. Keep it concise, factual, and current.

## Current phase

**Recovery Milestone 0 — Repository bootstrap complete**

The original source repository was lost. Historical 0.1.0 documentation survives under `reference/`, but no historical implementation claim is considered current until rebuilt and verified. Milestone 0 rebuilds only the reproducible repository foundation; it contains no financial behavior.

## Milestone 0 verification

Files added:

- `pyproject.toml` — package metadata (`quantcheck`, `0.1.0.dev0`, `requires-python = ">=3.12,<3.13"`), Hatchling build backend, `dev` dependency group (Ruff, MyPy, pytest, Hypothesis), Ruff/MyPy/pytest configuration, `quantcheck = "quantcheck.cli:main"` console script, and an sdist exclude for `.claude`/`.serena` local tool config.
- `uv.lock` — generated lockfile.
- `.python-version` — pins `3.12`.
- `src/quantcheck/__init__.py` — package marker exposing `__version__`; no financial behavior.
- `src/quantcheck/cli.py` — stdlib `argparse`-based entry point supporting only `--help`/`--version`; no subcommands.
- `tests/__init__.py`, `tests/test_package.py`, `tests/test_cli.py` — smoke tests for package import and CLI help/version behavior (in-process and via `python -m`).
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — GitHub Actions workflow running `uv sync --frozen --all-groups`, `uv lock --check`, Ruff check/format, MyPy, pytest, `quantcheck --help`, and `uv build`.
- `.gitignore` — standard Python/uv/tooling ignores.
- `README.md` — added "Current implementation status" and "Development setup" sections (existing recovery-harness explanation preserved).

Commands run and outcomes (Python 3.12.13 via `uv python install 3.12`, `uv` 0.12.2, default writable `~/.cache/uv`, no environment workaround needed):

- `uv sync --all-groups`: passed; generated `uv.lock`.
- `uv sync --frozen --all-groups`: passed.
- `uv run ruff check .`: passed.
- `uv run ruff format --check .`: passed (5 files).
- `uv run mypy src tests`: passed, strict mode, no issues in 5 source files.
- `uv run pytest`: passed, 4 tests, Hypothesis plugin loaded (not yet exercised by a property-based test — none is needed until financial logic exists).
- `uv lock --check`: passed.
- `uv run quantcheck --help`: exited 0 with usage text.
- `uv build --offline`: passed; built wheel and sdist. Wheel contains only `quantcheck/` package files and dist-info. Sdist initially included `.claude/` and `.serena/` local tool config; added a Hatchling sdist exclude at the time, but the sdist was **not** fully clean (see packaging correction below).

No environmental retries were needed.

## Packaging correction (post-Milestone-0 audit)

A follow-up audit found that after the `.claude`/`.serena` exclude fix, the sdist still bundled
the entire recovery harness: `reference/`, `prompts/`, `docs/`, `AGENTS.md`, `PROJECT_SCOPE.md`,
`MVP_ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.md`, `START_HERE.txt`, `RECOVERY_SEQUENCE.md`, and `IMPLEMENT.md`. The
wheel's long description also inherited the harness README's "rebuild harness" framing rather
than describing the actual package. Corrected by:

- Replacing the sdist `exclude`-only rule in `pyproject.toml` with an explicit `include`
  allowlist (`src/`, `tests/`, `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, `README.md`, `.python-version`,
  `.gitignore`) plus a defensive `exclude` list covering the recovery/reference files, local
  tool directories (`.claude`, `.serena`, `.venv`), `dist/`, and caches/bytecode.
- Rewriting `README.md` to describe the bootstrapped `quantcheck` repository directly (Milestone
  0 complete, what is not yet implemented, development setup, repository layout) instead of the
  "recovery harness" copy/paste instructions. `reference/` remains and is described as historical
  evidence only.
- Adding `.serena/` to `.gitignore` (directory left in place, only untracked from Git).

Rebuilt wheel and sdist after the fix; both verified clean of `.claude`, `.serena`, `reference/`,
recovery prompts/documents, local paths, secrets, caches, and generated environments.

## Decisions

- CLI entry point uses the Python standard library `argparse` rather than Typer for Milestone 0. Typer remains the fixed long-term CLI choice per `AGENTS.md`/`AGENTS_ORIGINAL.md`; introducing it now for a help-only placeholder would add a dependency for no behavioral benefit and risks establishing a competing/incomplete CLI shape before the contracted command surface (Recovery Phase 9) is designed. Revisit at the CLI milestone.
- Package version is `0.1.0.dev0` (not `0.1.0`) to avoid implying the historical 0.1.0 release is reproduced; the real `0.1.0` version should be set at the release-evidence milestone.
- `pytest` and `mypy` version ranges are unpinned upper-bound minors (`>=X,<Y+1`) consistent with keeping dependency additions minimal and explicit; exact resolved versions are captured in `uv.lock`.

## Known limitations

- No financial schemas, fixtures, point-in-time logic, SEC access, injectors, detectors, scoring, benchmark artifacts, or dashboard/HTML exist. None of the historical 0.1.0 test counts, benchmark metrics, or hashes are reproduced or claimed.
- The CLI has no subcommands and is expected to be replaced entirely at the CLI milestone (Recovery Phase 9).
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) has not yet run on GitHub Actions; it has only been validated by running its constituent commands locally.

## Exact next task

Implement the canonical domain layer (Recovery Phase 1 / Milestone 2): immutable Pydantic v2
schemas (`FinancialFact`, `CaseConfig`, `RuntimeMetadata`, `FaultManifest`,
`FaultManifestEntry`, `AuditInputSnapshot`, `Finding`, `AuditReport`, `ScoreReport`,
`DamageReport`), canonical JSON serialization, `Decimal`-as-string encoding, SHA-256 canonical
hashing, and row-order-independent stable IDs, with golden-vector tests. Do not implement fault
injection, detection, SEC access, or benchmark logic in that task.

## Fixed implementation choices

- Python: 3.12
- Package: `quantcheck`
- Dependency manager: `uv`
- Build backend: Hatchling
- Public schemas: Pydantic v2, introduced in the schemas milestone
- Lint and format: Ruff
- Type checking: MyPy
- Tests: pytest and Hypothesis
- CLI: Typer, introduced at the contracted milestone unless a minimal entry-point dependency is deliberately deferred
- HTTP: HTTPX, introduced with the SEC adapter
- Tabular processing: pandas and PyArrow, introduced only when required
- Dashboard: Streamlit, introduced only after benchmark and CLI stability

## Historical target

The prior release documentation describes a 0.1.0 implementation with four fault families, a 132-case frozen benchmark, a strict CLI, public/private artifacts, and read-only presentation. Those documents are design and acceptance references, not current status.
